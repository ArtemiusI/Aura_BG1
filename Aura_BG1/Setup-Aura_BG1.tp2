/**
 * Patch function. Returns the first free creature animation slot in the range defined by slotMin and slotMax.
 * INT_VAR slotMin    Lowest available creature animation slot for the animation, inclusive. (Default: 0)
 * INT_VAR slotMax    Highest available creature animation slot for the animation, exclusive.
 *                    (Default: highest value for slot type indicated by "slotMin")
 * INT_VAR slotSteps  How many slots to skip after each iteration, starting from slotMin.
 *                    Setting this parameter is useful if compatible animation slots are always 
 *                    a fixed distance apart (e.g. at a distance of 0x10 each). (Default: 1)
 * RET slot           A free animation slot. Returns -1 if none are found in the given range.

  SAY ~Artificer~
  SAY ~ARTIFICER: Lantanese artificers are master innovators and craftsmen, making up for their lack of combat or cloak-and-dagger skills with expert knowledge in use of arcane runes, deadly alchemical traps and metal automatons.

Advantages:
– +15 bonus to Lore.
– +10% bonus to Find Traps, Open Locks and Set Traps.
– May use the Set Alchemical Snare ability once per day in addition to the normal Thief's Set Snare. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 5 levels thereafter.

Set Alchemical Snare: Set a trap in the targeted location when no hostile creatures are in sight. Traps deal 1d4 (+1 extra damage per level) fire, cold, acid or electrical damage of the artificer's choice in a 10' radius, inflicting additional effects that last for 1 round per 3 levels of the artificer. Effects are dependent on the chosen element. Alchemical Snares can be set at a distance but can be set off by both allies and enemies.

  ALCHEMIST'S FIRE: Ignites the victim, dealing 1d4 damage per round.
  RAPID FREEZING REAGENT: Slows the victim.
  ACIDIC COMPOUND: Corrodes the victim's armor, reducing their AC by 4 and physical resistance by 20%.
  ELECTRIC CHARGE: Afflicts the victim with a 50% chance to miscast magic.

– May use the Craft Rune ability once per day.

CRAFT RUNE: Artificers can inscribe runes with arcane magic, which may be used to temporarily enhance weapons or to cast spells. The amount and strength of runes created depend on the artificer's level. Runes may not be crafted during combat.

– From level 4 onwards, may use the Advanced Alchemy ability once per day.

ADVANCED ALCHEMY: Lantanese artificers are skilled in chemistry and potion-making. This skill may be used once per day to craft a number of potions or alchemical weapons equal to half of the artificer's level. The types of potions available for crafting increase with the artificer's level.

– From level 8 onwards, may use the Craft Automaton ability once per day.

CRAFT AUTOMATON: The artificer spends two rounds to assimilate a powerful automaton which can be controlled at will. Automatons last until destroyed, are disabled if their creator is incapacitated, lose control if their creator's mind is affected and fall apart if their creator is killed. Only one automaton can be controlled at any given time.

Disadvantages:
– Hit Die: d4
– -10% penalty to Pick Pockets, Hide in Shadows and Move Silently.
– -1 penalty to THAC0 every 6 levels (starting at level 1).
– No backstab multiplier.
– May only distribute 20 skill points per level among thieving skills.~

When the wizard casts this spell, a jet of searing flame shoots from <PRO_HISHER> fingertips. The wizard's hands must be held so as to send forth a fanlike sheet of flames: <PRO_HISHER> thumbs must touch each other and the fingers must be spread. The burning hands send out flame jets of 5 ft. length in a horizontal arc of about 120 degrees in front of the wizard. The target suffers 1d3 points of damage, +2 points for each level of the caster, to a maximum of 1d3+20 points of fire damage. A creature that successfully saves vs. Spell receives half damage.~

Upon casting this spell, the wizard creates 1 image of <PRO_HIMHER>self that will travel alongside <PRO_HIMHER>. The image will perform all of the actions that the wizard does so that if any enemies are trying to attack the wizard, they will not know which one is real. There is a 50% chance that the attacker will attack the image and a 50% chance that he will attack the caster.

Upon casting this spell, a jet of flame appears at the caster's fingertips and bursts out toward one target of the caster's choice. That target will be hit by this flame for 3d6 points of damage. The flame jet strikes a second time halfway through its duration, and the caster may move while the spell is in effect.

Application of this spell increases the Strength of the character to 18 and then adds 50% bonus on top of this. The character receives any Strength bonuses appropriate. For example, if a character has between 18/50 and 18/00 Strength, then his Strength will just be set to 18/00. If a character has a Strength between 18/01 and 18/50, then his Strength will become 18/50 + original percentage. If his Strength is less than 18, then it will just become 18/50. However, this spell will actually lower a character's Strength if it is already 19 or more.~

When a Blur spell is cast, the wizard causes the outline of <PRO_HISHER> form to become blurred, shifting and wavering. This distortion causes all missile and melee combat attacks against the caster to be made with -3 penalties. The wizard also gains a +1 to all of <PRO_HISHER> Saving Throws.~

Saving Throw: 1/2 

A fireball is an explosive burst of flame that detonates with a low roar and delivers damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast itâ€”1d6 points of damage for each level of experience of the caster (up to a maximum of 10d6). The wizard points <PRO_HISHER> finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball (an early impact results in an early detonation). Creatures failing their Saves vs. Spell each suffer full damage from the blast. Those who roll successful Saving Throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each receiving half.~

Casting Time: 3 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: 1/2

Upon casting this spell, the wizard releases a powerful stroke of electrical energy that inflicts 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster (maximum damage of 10d6) to each creature within its area of effect. A successful Saving Throw vs. Spell reduces this damage to half (round fractions down). The bolt begins at a range and height decided by the caster and streaks outward in a direct line from the casting wizard (e.g., if a 40-ft. bolt was started at 180 ft. from the wizard, the far end of bolt would reach 220 ft. (180+40)). If the Lightning Bolt intersects with a wall, it will bounce until it reaches its full length.~

Saving Throw: None 

This spell causes all creatures within 20 ft. of the caster to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature(s) are not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature(s) detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature(s) or their gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature(s) become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature(s). The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the wizard or recipient cancels it, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. The invisible being(s) cannot open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, etc. If they attack, they immediately become visible, although the invisibility enables them to attack first.~

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None 

When a wizard casts this powerful spell upon <PRO_HIMHER>self, an outer skin of stone will move up from the ground, completely covering <PRO_HIMHER>. This skin is of course magical and will hinder the wizard in no way. The effect of this is to protect the wizard from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. For every 2 levels of the caster, an additional skin is gained upon casting. For example, a 10th-level wizard would receive 5 skins while a 20th-level wizard would receive 10. For each skin the wizard possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th-level wizard would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against <PRO_HIMHER>, but the 6th would affect <PRO_HIMHER> normally. The skins will remain on the wizard until <PRO_HESHE> is affected by a Dispel Magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell duration expires. It is important to note that this will not protect the wizard from any magical attacks, such as Fireball.~

This spell creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e., the area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the Minor Globe of Invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and some effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere, and these pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the Minor Globe. 4th and higher level spells are not affected by the globe.~

Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to Invisibility, but the recipient is able to attack by missile discharge, melee combat, or spellcasting while remaining unseen. However, telltale tracesâ€”a shimmeringâ€”allow an observant opponent to attack the invisible spell recipient. These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for (after the invisible character has made <PRO_HISHER> presence known). Attacks against the invisible character suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls, and the invisible character's Saving Throws are made with a +4 bonus.

Note: After making an attack, the wizard is no longer completely invisible. Opponents can target the wizard.~

Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None 

This spell is very similar to the 3rd-level spell Ghost Armor in that it creates a corporeal barrier around the target's body for the duration of the spell. This spell, however, actually taps in to the target's life force in order to create the barrier. The armor itself is weightless and does not hinder movement or spellcasting at all. The spirit armor does not work cumulatively with any other armor; however, Dexterity bonuses still apply as well as magic rings and shields. While in effect, the AC (Armor Class) of the recipient will be set to 1, as if <PRO_HESHE> were wearing plate mail. Also, due to the magical nature of the spell, <PRO_HESHE> will also receive a +3 bonus to Save vs. Spell. There is a danger however, as when the spell runs out, the external portion of the spirit is temporarily lost, inflicting 2d4 points of damage upon the target.~

A Sunfire is like a Fireball: An explosive burst of flame, which detonates with a low roar and delivers damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it: 1d6 points of damage for each level of experience of the spellcaster (up to a maximum of 15d6). The wizard gestures with <PRO_HISHER> hand and the entire area around <PRO_HIMHER> erupts in flames, striking all except for the caster. Creatures failing their Saving Throws each suffer full damage from the blast. Those who roll successful Saving Throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each receiving half.~

  SAY BIO ~When asked about her past, AURA tells you a long and convoluted tale of her life from her childhood to her life spent in faraway Kozakura. Born from the prestigious Glimmershine family in the "enlightened" island nation of Lantan, Aura's talent for artifice and creation at a young age coupled with a wide-idea curiosity of the world beyond her home led her to travel to distant lands looking to advance her knowledge of cultures and bring knowledge to other, less advanced societies. In one such venture, Aura's crew was assaulted by a magical storm which destroyed their ship and swept her away into the ocean.
  
Upon regaining consciousness, Aura found herself somehow in Kozakura, a nation in the land of Kara-Tur. Aura's talents in creation gave her a place among the locals of the village in which she made her new home for three years until a disastrous commission led to her disgrace and her subsequent leaving of Kozakura. She now seeks an adversary now in the Sword Coast, and has sought your aid in her quest.~

Regardless of how it is able to act as though it were alive, Muffy is doubtlessly a useful creation – the squirrel's stomach is a hollow compartment capable of storing small objects such as gems, potions or keys.

SAY DESC ~This strange bronze-colored contraption appears to be some sort of launcher. Its creator and late owner, Liro Mideveningwalker, was an intelligent yet ambitious gnome, and often sought out mysteries and secrets in dangerous places to increase her own knowledge. Her inexperience in combat led her to design this powerful cannon as a means for self defense. This weapon fires deadly lightning bolts that can strike down anything in its path. Liro's creativity also led her to add a variety of other implements to make it more effective. However, the energy that powers the weapon is limited and requires proper tools to recharge after too many uses. Between the cannon's notable weight and complex mechanisms, only a select few would be capable of using it effectively.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Armor Class: +6 vs. melee weapons
– Attacks per round set to 2
– Increased visual range
– Electrical Resistance: +100%

Combat abilities:
– The Thunderbolt does not launch projectiles. Instead, it fires a ray of lightning which deals 6d6+10 (save vs. breath weapons for half) electrical damage to all creatures within its line of fire and paralyzes them for two rounds on a failed save vs. breath. All targets struck are also Magnetized (-2 to AC vs. missiles and -20% missile damage resistance) for five rounds. The Thunderbolt strikes as a +6 weapon and may be fired 80 times before needing to recharge.

Edwall Dest drew his longbow and released the arrow with determination, not stopping to think how uncannily the target resembled himself. The missile split the large voodoo doll's head in twain, and at that moment, Edwall's head did much the same.

Aura's enhancements to the weapon include reshaping it into a composite weapon and adding several strange attachments. The bow has become significantly heavier and more difficult to draw as a consequence, but now fires mighty shots capable of shattering the most sturdy of defenses.

SAY NAME1 ~Quarterstaff~
SAY NAME2 ~Silver Staff Mace +2~
SAY DESC ~This weapon appears to be a normal large walking staff, but it has a faint aura of alteration magic. Uttering the command word causes the staff to assume the attributes of a mace, allowing it to be wielded with one hand. This was likely designed for Clerics or Druids, though that does not preclude use by most others.

Aura's enhancements have coated the Staff Mace with a plating of pure silver from the Werebane dagger, making it an effective weapon against lycanthropes.

SAY NAME1 ~Idol~
SAY NAME2 ~Idol of Kozah~
SAY DESC ~This idol depicts Kozah the Stormstar, a long-extinct god who was venerated and feared among the less-powerful strata of ancient Netherese society. Worship of this god of storms, earthquakes, strife, and rebellion was outlawed by many of the civilization's powerful archwizards. Many Kozahyn shrines and temples were therefore built in secretive, underground locations where the devout were better able to escape detection.

Aura's tinkering has somehow awakened a part of the power that lingers within the idol, making it a useful magical item. While held in one's hand, the idol can call down bolts of lightning from the sky to strike down enemies around them or create a Storm Shield around the bearer. However, the bearer's mind is wearied from constant battling against the rage induced by holding the idol close.

STATISTICS:

Charge abilities:
– Call Lightning three times per day
– Storm Shield once per day

Equipped abilities:
– May only be removed with a Remove Curse spell
– Wearer is immune to lightning strikes, Call Lightning and Lightning Bolt
– Electricity Resistance: +20%
– All electrical damage inflicted by the wearer is increased by 15%
– Save vs. Spells: -3 penalty

SAY NAME2 ~The Ossifier~
SAY DESC ~Cursed Staff of Petrification: The Ossifier
The surface of this seven-foot shaft more resembles stone than wood, but in the hands of a skilled wielder it weighs little more than a staff of oak. Along its length appear the ghost-like images of various foes caught in defensive postures, appearing almost as thought they had been suddenly turned to stone.

Aura's enhancements have managed to turn the cursed weapon into something more beneficial, albeit still largely useless.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– May only be removed by a Remove Curse spell
– Stoneskin on user when equipped (five skins, re-applied upon re-equipping)
– Barkskin (base AC set to 6)

Combat abilities:
– 1% chance to petrify target on strike on a failed save vs. spell

SAY DESC ~Crafted by dwarves in service to the temple of Waukeen in Amn, this two-handed sword draws power from the gold in its wielder's purse. For the wealthy it strikes mighty blows. For the impoverished, the Gold Digger is no better than a mundane greatsword.

Aura's enhancements have somehow managed to reverse-engineer the weapon's enchantments, causing large showers of gold coins to burst from the bodies of the fallen and starting a gold frenzy in the wielder, urging them to kill more quickly.

STATISTICS:

Special:
– Consumes 10 gold per successful hit
– Upon killing a target, gain 100 gold and deal +4 melee damage for the next round.

  SAY BIO ~When asked about her past, AURA tells you a long and convoluted tale of her life from her childhood to her life spent in faraway Kozakura. Born from the prestigious Glimmershine family in the "enlightened" island nation of Lantan, Aura's talent for artifice and creation at a young age coupled with a wide-idea curiosity of the world beyond her home led her to travel to distant lands looking to advance her knowledge of cultures and bring knowledge to other, less advanced societies. In one such venture, Aura's crew was assaulted by a magical storm which destroyed their ship and swept her away into the ocean.
  
Upon regaining consciousness, Aura found herself somehow in Kozakura, a nation in the land of Kara-Tur. Aura's talents in creation gave her a place among the locals of the village in which she made her new home for three years until a disastrous commission led to her disgrace and her subsequent leaving of Kozakura. Within the Sword Coast, she eventually crossed paths with her adversary and former friend, the disgraced samurai Tadahashi Saitō, and ended his life with great regret.

During her travels north, Aura was repeatedly forced to evade or defend herself against crusaders who would doubtlessly force her to use her great technological intellect to further their goals. Though adverse to the idea of violence, she has allied herself with the Flaming Fist both for her own protection and to fight as her own choice.~
