  SAY ~Artificer~
  SAY ~ARTIFICER: Lantanese artificers are master innovators and craftsmen, making up for their lack of combat or cloak-and-dagger skills with expert knowledge in use of arcane runes, deadly alchemical traps and metal automatons.

Advantages:
– +20 bonus to Lore.
– +5 additional Lore per level gained.
– +10% bonus to Find Traps, Open Locks and Set Traps.

Traps deal 2d4 (+1d4 extra damage per 3 levels) fire, cold, acid or electrical damage of the artificer's choice in a 10' radius, inflicting additional effects that last for 2 rounds + 1 round per 3 levels of the artificer. Effects are dependent on the chosen element. Alchemical Snares can only be set off by enemies, but affect all within its area of effect.

  ALCHEMIST'S FIRE: Trap damage increases to d6 and sets targets Aflame, dealing an additional 1d4 fire damage per round.
  RAPID FREEZE: Targets become Slowed, suffering a -4 penalty to THAC0 and Armor Class.

  ELECTRIC CHARGE: Targets become Shocked, suffering a 10% chance every round to become Paralyzed for 1 round.

– May use the Advanced Alchemy ability at will.

ADVANCED ALCHEMY: Lantanese artificers are skilled in chemistry and potion-making. This skill may be used to craft a number of potions or alchemical weapons. The types of potions available for crafting increase with the artificer's level.

ANALYZE: With this ability, the user carefully observes the target and identifies their strengths and weaknesses, revealing their Hit Die, THAC0, Saving Throws, Magic Resistance, Damage Resistance and vulnerability to Poison and Backstabs. This ability may be used an unlimited number of times.

– 3rd level: May use the Infusion ability once per day.

INFUSION: The artificer infuses their allies' weapons. All party members' weapons are treated as having a +1 enchantment for the purposes of determining what they can hit for 8 hours. This ability can only be used outside of combat.

– 8th level: Infusion's enchantment bonus increases to +2.
– 9th level: May use the Craft Automaton ability once per day.

CRAFT AUTOMATON: The artificer spends two rounds to assimilate a powerful automaton which can be controlled at will.

Only one automaton can be controlled at any given time.

– 10th level: Gains an additional use of Craft Rune.
– 16th level: Infusion's enchantment bonus increases to +3.

Set a trap in the targeted location when no hostile creatures are in sight. Traps deal 2d4 (+1d4 extra damage per 3 levels) fire, cold, acid or electrical damage of the artificer's choice in a 10' radius, inflicting additional effects that last for 2 rounds + 1 round per 3 levels of the artificer. Effects are dependent on the chosen element. Alchemical Snares can only be set off by enemies, but affect all within its area of effect.

  ALCHEMIST'S FIRE: Trap damage increases to d6 and sets targets Aflame, dealing an additional 1d4 fire damage per round.
  RAPID FREEZE: Targets become Slowed, suffering a -4 penalty to THAC0 and Armor Class.
  ACIDIC COMPOUND: Targets are afflicted with Corrosion, suffering a -25% penalty to Physical Resistance and Damage.
  ELECTRIC CHARGE: Targets become Shocked, suffering a 10% chance every round to become Paralyzed for 1 round.~

Automatons last until destroyed and cannot be controlled but will defend their creators, are disabled if their creator is incapacitated, lose control if their creator's mind is affected and fall apart if their creator is killed.

Only one automaton can be controlled at any given time.~

When thrown, releases a cloud for one turn which deals Poison Damage each round. Creatures standing in the cloud have their field of vision greatly reduced and suffer a -4 penalty to THAC0. Creatures must additionally make a Save vs. Breath Weapons each round or suffer a penalty to Armor Class and Saving Throws for three rounds.

SAY DESC ~This devastating explosive contains a special compound crafted from Lantanese smokepowder and Shou explosive powder. The compound powder is so dangerous that only a small amount must be used, which must be contained within a vibration-resistant canister which is afterwards placed within a larger canister with considerable space inbetween both. When it detonates, the destructive force of the powder obliterates everything within its range.

STATISTICS:

When thrown, unleashes a devastating explosion which deals massive Fire and Electrical Damage, Deafens all targets and Stuns for five rounds on a failed Save vs. Death. Targets take damage as though their Fire and Electrical Resistances are halved (e.g. 100% Resistance takes 50% Damage)
