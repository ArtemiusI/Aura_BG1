Set a trap in the targeted location when no hostile creatures are in sight. Traps deal 1d4 (+1 extra damage per level) fire, cold, acid or electrical damage of the artificer's choice in a 10' radius, inflicting additional effects that last for 1 round per 3 levels of the artificer. Effects are dependent on the chosen element. Alchemical Snares can be set at a distance but can be set off by both allies and enemies.

  ALCHEMIST'S FIRE: Ignites the victim, dealing 1d4 damage per round.
  RAPID FREEZE: Slows the victim.
  ACIDIC COMPOUND: Corrodes the victim's armor, reducing their AC by 4 and physical resistance by 20%.
  ELECTRIC CHARGE: Afflicts the victim with a 50% chance to miscast magic.~

  SAY ~Artificer~
  SAY ~ARTIFICER: Lantanese artificers are master innovators and craftsmen, making up for their lack of combat or cloak-and-dagger skills with expert knowledge in use of arcane runes, deadly alchemical traps and metal automatons.

Advantages:
– +15 bonus to Lore.
– +10% bonus to Find Traps, Open Locks and Set Traps.
– May use the Set Alchemical Snare ability once per day in addition to the normal Thief's Set Snare. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 5 levels thereafter.

Set Alchemical Snare: Set a trap in the targeted location when no hostile creatures are in sight. Traps deal 1d4 (+1 extra damage per level) fire, cold, acid or electrical damage of the artificer's choice in a 10' radius, inflicting additional effects that last for 1 round per 3 levels of the artificer. Effects are dependent on the chosen element. Alchemical Snares can be set at a distance but can be set off by both allies and enemies.

  ALCHEMIST'S FIRE: Ignites the victim, dealing 1d4 damage per round.
  RAPID FREEZING REAGENT: Slows the victim.
  ACIDIC COMPOUND: Corrodes the victim's armor, reducing their AC by 4 and physical resistance by 20%.
  ELECTRIC CHARGE: Afflicts the victim with a 50% chance to miscast magic.

– May use the Craft Rune ability once per day.

CRAFT RUNE: Artificers can inscribe runes with arcane magic, which may be used to temporarily enhance weapons or to cast spells. The amount and strength of runes created depend on the artificer's level. Runes may not be crafted during combat.

– May use the Advanced Alchemy ability at will.

ADVANCED ALCHEMY: Lantanese artificers are skilled in chemistry and potion-making. This skill may be used to craft a number of potions or alchemical weapons. The types of potions available for crafting increase with the artificer's level.

– From level 8 onwards, may use the Craft Automaton ability once per day.

CRAFT AUTOMATON: The artificer spends two rounds to assimilate a powerful automaton which can be controlled at will. Automatons last until destroyed, are disabled if their creator is incapacitated, lose control if their creator's mind is affected and fall apart if their creator is killed. Only one automaton can be controlled at any given time.

Disadvantages:
– Hit Die: d4
– -10% penalty to Pick Pockets, Hide in Shadows and Move Silently.
– -1 penalty to THAC0 every 6 levels (starting at level 1).
– No backstab multiplier.
– May only distribute 20 skill points per level among thieving skills.~

  SAY BIO ~When asked about her past, AURA tells you a long and convoluted tale of her life from her childhood to her life spent in faraway Kozakura. Born from the prestigious Glimmershine family in the "enlightened" island nation of Lantan, Aura's talent for artifice and creation at a young age coupled with a wide-idea curiosity of the world beyond her home led her to travel to distant lands looking to advance her knowledge of cultures and bring knowledge to other, less advanced societies. In one such venture, Aura's crew was assaulted by a magical storm which destroyed their ship and swept her away into the ocean.
  
Upon regaining consciousness, Aura found herself somehow in Kozakura, a nation in the land of Kara-Tur. Aura's talents in creation gave her a place among the locals of the village in which she made her new home for three years until a disastrous commission led to her disgrace and her subsequent leaving of Kozakura. She now seeks an adversary in the Sword Coast, and has sought your aid in her quest.~

Within the Sword Coast, she eventually crossed paths with her adversary and former friend, the disgraced samurai Tadahashi Saito, and ended his life with great regret.

During her travels north, Aura was repeatedly forced to evade or defend herself against crusaders who would doubtlessly force her to use her great technological intellect to further their goals. Though adverse to the idea of violence, she has allied herself with the Flaming Fist both for her own protection and to fight as her own choice.~

  SAY ~illusionist / artificer~
  SAY ~Illusionist / Artificer~
  SAY ~ILLUSIONIST/ARTIFICER: This character can use the abilities of a Mage and an Artificer, though Mage spells cannot be cast while wearing armor.
  
Gnomes can choose this multi-class, but become Illusionist/Artificers by default. Gnomes are the only race that can combine a specialist Mage class in a multi-class.
  
ARTIFICER: Lantanese artificers are master innovators and craftsmen, making up for their lack of combat or cloak-and-dagger skills with expert knowledge in use of arcane runes, deadly alchemical traps and metal automatons.

Advantages:
– +15 bonus to Lore.
– +10% bonus to Find Traps, Open Locks and Set Traps.
– May use the Set Alchemical Snare ability once per day in addition to the normal Thief's Set Snare. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 5 levels thereafter.

Set Alchemical Snare: Set a trap in the targeted location when no hostile creatures are in sight. Traps deal 1d4 (+1 extra damage per level) fire, cold, acid or electrical damage of the artificer's choice in a 10' radius, inflicting additional effects that last for 1 round per 3 levels of the artificer. Effects are dependent on the chosen element. Alchemical Snares can be set at a distance but can be set off by both allies and enemies.

  ALCHEMIST'S FIRE: Ignites the victim, dealing 1d4 damage per round.
  RAPID FREEZING REAGENT: Slows the victim.
  ACIDIC COMPOUND: Corrodes the victim's armor, reducing their AC by 4 and physical resistance by 20%.
  ELECTRIC CHARGE: Afflicts the victim with a 50% chance to miscast magic.

– May use the Craft Rune ability once per day.

CRAFT RUNE: Artificers can inscribe runes with arcane magic, which may be used to temporarily enhance weapons or to cast spells. The amount and strength of runes created depend on the artificer's level. Runes may not be crafted during combat.

– From level 4 onwards, may use the Advanced Alchemy ability at will.

ADVANCED ALCHEMY: Lantanese artificers are skilled in chemistry and potion-making. This skill may be used to craft a number of potions or alchemical weapons. The types of potions available for crafting increase with the artificer's level.

– From level 8 onwards, may use the Craft Automaton ability once per day.

CRAFT AUTOMATON: The artificer spends two rounds to assimilate a powerful automaton which can be controlled at will. Automatons last until destroyed, are disabled if their creator is incapacitated, lose control if their creator's mind is affected and fall apart if their creator is killed. Only one automaton can be controlled at any given time.

Disadvantages:
– -10% penalty to Pick Pockets, Hide in Shadows and Move Silently.
– -1 penalty to THAC0 every 6 levels (starting at level 1).
– No backstab multiplier.
– May only distribute 20 skill points per level among thieving skills.~

  SAY BIO ~When asked about her past, AURA tells you a long and convoluted tale of her life from her childhood to her life spent in faraway Kozakura. Born from the prestigious Glimmershine family in the "enlightened" island nation of Lantan, Aura's talent for artifice and creation at a young age coupled with a wide-idea curiosity of the world beyond her home led her to travel to distant lands looking to advance her knowledge of cultures and bring knowledge to other, less advanced societies. In one such venture, Aura's crew was assaulted by a magical storm which destroyed their ship and swept her away into the ocean.
  
Upon regaining consciousness, Aura found herself somehow in Kozakura, a nation in the land of Kara-Tur. Aura's talents in creation gave her a place among the locals of the village in which she made her new home for three years until a disastrous commission led to her disgrace and her subsequent leaving of Kozakura. She now seeks an adversary in the Sword Coast, and has sought your aid in her quest.~

Within the Sword Coast, she eventually crossed paths with her adversary and former friend, the disgraced samurai Tadahashi Saito, and ended his life with great regret.

During her travels north, Aura was repeatedly forced to evade or defend herself against crusaders who would doubtlessly force her to use her great technological intellect to further their goals. Though adverse to the idea of violence, she has allied herself with the Flaming Fist both for her own protection and to fight as her own choice.~

  SAY BIO ~When asked about her past, AURA tells you a long and convoluted tale of her life from her childhood to her life spent in faraway Kozakura. Born from the prestigious Glimmershine family in the "enlightened" island nation of Lantan, Aura's talent for artifice and creation at a young age coupled with a wide-idea curiosity of the world beyond her home led her to travel to distant lands looking to advance her knowledge of cultures and bring knowledge to other, less advanced societies. In one such venture, Aura's crew was assaulted by a magical storm which destroyed their ship and swept her away into the ocean. Upon regaining consciousness, Aura found herself somehow in Kozakura, a nation in the land of Kara-Tur. Aura's talents in creation gave her a place among the locals of the village in which she made her new home for three years.
  
Since leaving Kozakura, Aura has travelled across the Sword Coast searching for lost knowledge and curiosities before arriving in Amn, where she befriended the Jansen family and found a temporary home with them in Athkatla, where she continues to develop various inventions and study at various houses of knowledge.~

  SAY ~Priestess / Artificer~
  SAY ~PRIESTESS/ARTIFICER: This character can use the abilities of a Priestess and an Artificer, though weapons are restricted to only those allowed by the Priestess's ethos. Thieving skills cannot be used while wearing more than studded leather armor.
  
ARTIFICER: Lantanese artificers are master innovators and craftsmen, making up for their lack of combat or cloak-and-dagger skills with expert knowledge in use of arcane runes, deadly alchemical traps and metal automatons.

Advantages:
– +15 bonus to Lore.
– +10% bonus to Find Traps, Open Locks and Set Traps.
– May use the Set Alchemical Snare ability once per day in addition to the normal Thief's Set Snare. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 5 levels thereafter.

Set Alchemical Snare: Set a trap in the targeted location when no hostile creatures are in sight. Traps deal 1d4 (+1 extra damage per level) fire, cold, acid or electrical damage of the artificer's choice in a 10' radius, inflicting additional effects that last for 1 round per 3 levels of the artificer. Effects are dependent on the chosen element. Alchemical Snares can be set at a distance but can be set off by both allies and enemies.

  ALCHEMIST'S FIRE: Ignites the victim, dealing 1d4 damage per round.
  RAPID FREEZING REAGENT: Slows the victim.
  ACIDIC COMPOUND: Corrodes the victim's armor, reducing their AC by 4 and physical resistance by 20%.
  ELECTRIC CHARGE: Afflicts the victim with a 50% chance to miscast magic.

– May use the Craft Rune ability once per day.

CRAFT RUNE: Artificers can inscribe runes with arcane magic, which may be used to temporarily enhance weapons or to cast spells. The amount and strength of runes created depend on the artificer's level. Runes may not be crafted during combat.

– From level 4 onwards, may use the Advanced Alchemy ability at will.

ADVANCED ALCHEMY: Lantanese artificers are skilled in chemistry and potion-making. This skill may be used to craft a number of potions or alchemical weapons. The types of potions available for crafting increase with the artificer's level.

– From level 8 onwards, may use the Craft Automaton ability once per day.

CRAFT AUTOMATON: The artificer spends two rounds to assimilate a powerful automaton which can be controlled at will. Automatons last until destroyed, are disabled if their creator is incapacitated, lose control if their creator's mind is affected and fall apart if their creator is killed. Only one automaton can be controlled at any given time.

Disadvantages:
– -10% penalty to Pick Pockets, Hide in Shadows and Move Silently.
– -1 penalty to THAC0 every 6 levels (starting at level 1).
– No backstab multiplier.
– May only distribute 20 skill points per level among thieving skills.

PRIESTESS: Priestesses of the Way, a Kozakuran faith, are believers in harmony and seek to understand how to manipulate the forces that keep the world in balance, gaining powers similar to that of divine magic in the process. Many dedicate themselves to wandering the land for knowledge, tending to sacred shrines, or becoming philosophers.

Advantages:
– May cast Protection from Evil as an innate ability.
– From 6th level onwards, may cast Protection from Evil 10' Radius as an innate ability.
– From 11th level onwards, may cast True Seeing as an innate ability.

Disadvantages:
– May only be proficient in clubs, quarterstaves, short bows and slings.
– May not wear armor heavier than studded leather.
– May not be chaotic or evil-aligned.~

Within the Sword Coast, she eventually crossed paths with her adversary and former friend, the disgraced samurai Tadahashi Saito, and ended his life with great regret.

During her travels north, Aura was repeatedly forced to evade or defend herself against crusaders who would doubtlessly force her to use her great technological intellect to further their goals. Though adverse to the idea of violence, she has allied herself with the Flaming Fist both for her own protection and to fight as her own choice.~

  SAY BIO ~When asked about her past, AURA tells you a long and convoluted tale of her life from her childhood to her life spent in faraway Kozakura. Born from the prestigious Glimmershine family in the "enlightened" island nation of Lantan, Aura's talent for artifice and creation at a young age coupled with a wide-idea curiosity of the world beyond her home led her to travel to distant lands looking to advance her knowledge of cultures and bring knowledge to other, less advanced societies. In one such venture, Aura's crew was assaulted by a magical storm which destroyed their ship and swept her away into the ocean. Upon regaining consciousness, Aura found herself somehow in Kozakura, a nation in the land of Kara-Tur. Aura's talents in creation gave her a place among the locals of the village in which she made her new home for three years.
  
Since leaving Kozakura, Aura has travelled across the Sword Coast searching for lost knowledge and curiosities before arriving in Amn, where she befriended the Jansen family and found a temporary home with them in Athkatla, where she continues to develop various inventions and study at various houses of knowledge.~
