1. Overview
==============================================

Aura Glimmershine is a young lawful good-aligned gnome artificer and inventor from the island nation of Lantan. She can be found at the Beregost town square. She begins at a minimum level of one and has the following attributes:

   - STR: 8
   - DEX: 16
   - CON: 13
   - INT: 19
   - WIS: 14
   - CHA: 15

She joins with a small selection of personal items. If the PC is female, she may show hints of romantic attraction, though there is no full romance within BG1.

In Siege of Dragonspear, she can be found in the Coast Way Forest, after leaving Baldur's Gate.

Additionally, she has crossmod content with the mod NPCs Sirene, Drake, Verr'Sza and White.

3. Artificer Kit (Thief)
==============================================

ARTIFICER: Lantanese artificers are master innovators and craftsmen, making up for their lack of combat or cloak-and-dagger skills with expert knowledge in use of arcane runes, deadly alchemical traps and metal automatons.

Advantages:
- +15 bonus to Lore.
- +10% bonus to Find Traps, Open Locks and Set Traps.
- May use the Set Alchemical Snare ability once per day in addition to the normal Thief's Set Snare. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 5 levels thereafter.

Set Alchemical Snare: Set a trap in the targeted location when no hostile creatures are in sight. Traps deal 1d4 (+1 extra damage per level) fire, cold, acid or electrical damage of the artificer's choice in a 10' radius, inflicting additional effects that last for 1 round per 3 levels of the artificer. Effects are dependent on the chosen element. Alchemical Snares can be set at a distance but can be set off by both allies and enemies.

ALCHEMIST'S FIRE: Ignites the victim, dealing 1d4 damage per round.
RAPID FREEZE: Slows the victim.
ACIDIC COMPOUND: Corrodes the victim's armor, reducing their AC by 4 and physical resistance by 20%.
ELECTRIC CHARGE: Afflicts the victim with a 50% chance to miscast magic.

- May use the Craft Rune ability once per day.

CRAFT RUNE: Artificers can inscribe runes with arcane magic, which may be used to cast spells or temporarily empower an automaton. The amount and strength of runes created depend on the artificer's level. Runes may not be crafted during combat.

- From level 4 onwards, may use the Advanced Alchemy ability once per day.

ADVANCED ALCHEMY: Lantanese artificers are skilled in chemistry and potion-making. This skill may be used once per day to craft a number of potions or alchemical weapons equal to half of the artificer's level. The types of potions available for crafting increase with the artificer's level.

From level 8 onwards, may use the Craft Automaton ability once per day.

CRAFT AUTOMATON: The artificer spends two rounds to assimilate a powerful automaton which can be controlled at will. Automatons last until destroyed, are disabled if their creator is incapacitated, lose control if their creator's mind is affected and fall apart if their creator is killed. Only one automaton can be controlled at any given time.

Disadvantages:
Hit Die: d4
-10% penalty to Pick Pockets, Hide in Shadows and Move Silently.
-1 penalty to THAC0 every 6 levels (starting at level 1).
No backstab multiplier.
- May only distribute 20 skill points per level among thieving skills.

4. Frequently Asked Questions
==============================================

Q: Why can't I remove Aura's bow or amulet?
A: Aura's magatama necklace and Sunshooter carry immeasurable value to her and she will not remove them for anything.

Q: Does the Sunshooter ever get upgraded?
A: Yes. It upgrades at levels 5, 8 and 11.

Q: What are the prerequisites to starting a romance with Aura?
A: In BG1, there are no requirements besides being female as the romantic implications are little more than subtext. In SoD, the PC needs a minimum Charisma of 10 and Intelligence of 12, as well as being non-evil aligned. The PC may be of any race or class.

Q: How well/badly does Aura get along with the original cast?
A: While Aura will never become violent or leave due to another party member, she does get along with certain characters better than others, though most have plenty to talk about with her regardless. An overview of her relations are listed below:

  Likes: Dynaheir, Imoen, Kivan, Yeslick, Khalid, Edwin, Quayle, Ajantis, Garrick, Glint
  Neutral/Unsure: Safana, Alora, Viconia, Minsc, Branwen, Skie, Rasaad, Corwin
  Bemused: Tiax, Xzar, Baeloth, Coran, Xan, Neera, Voghiln
  Afraid: Jaheira, Faldorn, Dorn, Shar-Teel, M'Khiin
  Dislikes: Kagain, Montaron, Eldoth

Q: When will Aura be able to create explosive weapons?
A: After completing her personal quest, she will gain the option via her Advanced Alchemy ability.

Q: Why is she frightened of bears?
A: She just is. Bears are pretty terrifying for a small, timid gnome girl. Be careful not to let one get too close to her or she may lose morale and flee.

Q: I insulted Aura too many times and made her angry. Now she won't talk to me. What do I do?
A: Force-talk her and apologize. She will accept your apology ONCE only. If you insult her again, she will shut down her dialogue permanently.

Q: Can I persuade Aura to keep the masterwork katana?
A: Yes. You must be non-evil and have 14+ Charisma. Bear in mind Aura herself will refuse to wield it.
